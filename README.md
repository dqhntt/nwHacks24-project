## Inspiration
Task Trove was inspired by the need to rebuild the sense of community in a person's local neighborhood. We feel like people now a days are not connected to their neighbors as they were in the past so we developed this app to increase connection through gamification and incentives! 

## What it does
TaskTrove allows community members to help others in need through a fun, gamified approach. On TaskTrove users can post a problem or project they need help with and ping community members to come to their aid. Users can then take on tasks and win points! These points can be used to gain rewards from local business' such as coupons or gift-cards. Through our app neighbors can build connections and create lasting memories.

## How we built it
**hard work and dedication.** On a technical note we built it using a MERN stack with UI design done in Figma and Authentication done with Auth0. We also used Github for collaboration!

## Challenges we ran into
_Finding a place to sit with power._  We also struggled to learn how to use the MERN stack and implementing out desired UI using React. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we built. We feel our idea is very strong to help with building community. It was our first time using the MERN stack as well and we were able to connect everything which is amazing!

## What we learned
What we learnt through building our project was how to use the MERN stack. This was our groups first time using the MERN stack and we did a pretty great job!

## What's next for TaskTrover
Next for TaskTrover we would continue building a nicer UI similar to our mock-ups. Next we would add a  greater features for user safety. We could also add in a AI model to help estimate the difficulty of the tasks so it would be less dependent on the user. We would also add a reviewing feature where users can review the people who came to help and also vice versa.
